              <span  class="e37_100">summon creatures, and generally create an advantage for themselves.</span>
              <span  class="e37_103">Some cards have special effects such as causing vulnerability poison, drawing cards...etc </span>
              <span  class="e37_104">Each cards require Action Cost to be used. Players have 5 Action Points per turn</span>
