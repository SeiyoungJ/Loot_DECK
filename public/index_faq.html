              <span  class="e53_143">Loot is a collection of 8,000 unique bags of adventuring gear, originally released by Dom Hofmann. Each loot bag contains 8 items: a piece for an adventurer's chest, foot, hand, head, neck, ring, waist, and weapon. Go to <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/" target="_blank">www.lootproject.com</a> for more information.</span>
              <span  class="e53_145">Deck is a project to create a TCG or Trading Card Game on top of Loot. It’s a small passion project started by <a href="https://twitter.com/FrappeMango" target="_blank">@FrappeMango</a> in hopes to be able to create a Web3 integrated Multiplayer game. The project focuses on creating cards based on data / lore from Loot and creatinga game where you can use these cards.</span>
              <span  class="e53_147">As Deck is still a WIP project, the game isn’t finished as of writing. However, to show progress the latest version of the game is in the “Game” tab of this website.</span>
              <span  class="e53_149">Yes, if you are able to Code, Draw, Write, Build or just have a cool idea, feel free to contact <a href="https://twitter.com/FrappeMango" target="_blank">@FrappeMango</a> on Twitter. Let’s build this project together!</span>
              <span  class="e53_151">The game will steadily be built into a working project. This is the current timeline for this game.</span>
